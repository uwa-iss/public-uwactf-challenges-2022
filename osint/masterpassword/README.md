# Challenge

**Name:** Master Password

**Category:** OSINT

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Author:** Alex Brown (ghostccamm)

**Flag:** `P@ssW0rd123`

## Description

I think the UISS president leaked their own master password on the club Discord!

**Can you find the UISS president's master password?**

*The flag is just the password with no `ISS{}`. If you think you have the right password, but it says the flag is incorrect then try changing `O` to `0`.*

## Solution

Well I am the president of UISS (GhostCcamm) on the discord. Searching the discord for message by GhostCcamm (search `password from: GhostCcamm#2366`), you can see that they wrote "I just keep my master password on my bottle to help remember it" in the memes channel. Jumping to that message you can see a picture of his water bottle with the password `P@ssW0rd123` on it.
