Based on the boats and the formation of the jetti's / land formation it is clear that this is Fremantle.

From the shape of the rock formation and the fact that this is an Island it narrows down the possability. There is only two options this can be. Garden Island and Rottnest Island.
You can then look on google map and find the exact area in the photo.
