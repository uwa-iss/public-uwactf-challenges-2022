## Description

Our famous marketing officer (Cursor) went a bit wild with our marketing for UWACTF. We believe that he is actually a CFC spy agent and has secretly leaked one of the flags for UWACTF!

Can you find the flag that Cursor leaked?

## Solution

Looking at the marketing that was released leading up to UWACTF, the marketing image for "1 Day Left" had the flag in the bottom right corner of the image.
