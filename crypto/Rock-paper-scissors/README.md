## Description

What are the odds to win rock paper scissors 100 times in a row? ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…   
Take your TIME to think about it

*Hint: -127 <= OFFSET <= 127*

## Solution

In the handler function of the server code, we can see that the seed is generated by time.time() function plus an arbitrary offset value.    
The random seed is then set by using that variable. 

```
seed = int(time.time()) + OFFSET
random.seed(seed)
```

To win rounds, write a if-else statement to choose a winning option in every round against computer choice

All the computer choices are randomized using the seed variable.  
If you set the seed in a similar way in your solve script, you can randomize the same choice of rock paper scissors as the server computer player.  
As OFFSET is unknown small value, you could bruteforce all possible OFFSET value until find the correct one - the one that set the correct seed to win every round.

In the solve script, you can see the implementation using pwntool.
